# Representing Point Clouds with Generative Conditional Invertible Flow Networks

Master's thesis written under the supervision of dr hab. Jan Chorowski at the University of Wroclaw, and defended on August 2020.

## Topics covered:
* Latent variable methods (EM algorithm, VAEs, normalizing flows, GANs)
* PointNet - NN architecture for point cloud processing
* Generative models for point clouds (l-GAN, PointFlow)
* Evaluation metrics
* Our approach - Conditional Invertible Flow (CIF)

You can find our paper and PyTorch implementation of CIF in this [repo](https://github.com/MStypulkowski/CIF).
